       ","
     Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods that learn a compressed representation of a machine-learned model (e.g., neural network) via representation of the model parameters within a reparameterization space during training of the model. In particular, the present disclosure describes an end-to-end model weight compression approach that employs a latent-variable data compression method. The model parameters (e.g., weights and biases) are represented in a “latent” or “reparameterization” space, amounting to a reparameterization. In some implementations, this space can be equipped with a learned probability model, which is used first to impose an entropy penalty on the parameter representation during training, and second to compress the representation using arithmetic coding after training. The proposed approach can thus maximize accuracy and model compressibility jointly, in an end-to-end fashion, with the rate-error trade-off specified by a hyperparameter.

     To ensure proper operation (e.g., speed and/or function) of standard cells fabricated within an integrated circuit a minimum potential difference between the high and low power supply rails needs to be maintained. IR drop refers to a reduction in the potential difference between the power supply rails and is caused when the switching activity of cells that share a power supply rail is greater than can be provided at a particular time. Before fabrication, placement of the cells is reorganized within bounding box regions. Power density across the power rails within each bounding box is normalized based on spatial and temporal power density characteristics of each cell. The reorganization is IR aware and has minimal impact on timing and IR drop is mitigated because distributing current consumption between the supply rails reduces current spikes and IR drops.

More specifically, information about a number of Handover (HO) attempts made between a source network node and each of its neighboring network nodes for a predefined period of time and a number of occurrences of each type of HO problems during the HO attempts are collected as a data vector. Then, for each “source network node—neighboring network node” pair, two data sub-vectors are obtained by aggregating the numbers from the data vector at a carrier level and an inter-node level, respectively.
